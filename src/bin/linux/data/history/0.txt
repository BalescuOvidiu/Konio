Ancient Greece Warfare
Warfare occurred throughout the history of ancient Greece, from
the Greek Dark Ages onward. The Greek 'Dark Age' drew to a
close as a significant increase in population allowed urbanized culture
to be restored, which led to the rise of the city-states (Poleis).
These developments ushered in theperiod of Archaic Greece
(800-480 BC). The fractious nature of Ancient Greek society seems
to have made continuous conflict on this larger scale inevitable.

Along with the rise of the city-state evolved a new style of warfare:
the hoplite phalanx. Hoplites were armored infantryman, armed with
spear and shield, and the phalanx was a formation of these soldiers 
with their shields locked together and spears pointed forward. The
horsemen are rich men and oarsmen are poor men of polis.*
