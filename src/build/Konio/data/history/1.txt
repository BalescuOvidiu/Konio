Ancient Greece Mithology
Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong 
to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature 
of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult 
and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece.

Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to 
shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient
Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature
of myth-making itself.

Greek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of
narratives, and implicitly in Greek representational arts, such as
vase-paintings and votive gifts.
